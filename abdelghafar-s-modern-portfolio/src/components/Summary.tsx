            I am a philosophy graduate with strong analytical skills, high attention to detail, and excellent problem-solving abilities. 
            I am used to handling tasks that require accuracy, focus, and consistency. I also have practical experience in web development (React & Next.js), 
            which improved my technical adaptability and quick-learning capabilities. I am seeking an entry-level opportunity where I can grow professionally, 
            contribute effectively, and support team goals.
